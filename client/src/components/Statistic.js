import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function Statistic() {
  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <h1> This is statistics page</h1>
        <p>
          My idea for statistics was to fetch everything from audit tabel, but
          you can decide yourself :)
        </p>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
